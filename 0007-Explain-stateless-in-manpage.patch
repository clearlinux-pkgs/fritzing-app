+This distribution includes a read-only copy of Fritzing's parts database in
+/usr/share/fritzing that is used by default. If a user-specific copy in
+~/.local/share/fritzing, or a system-wide copy in /var/lib/fritzing exists,
+it will be used instead. You can populate either path by cloning the
+fritzing-parts repository in it, e.g.:
+git clone https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-parts.git <PATH>/fritzing-parts
+If this path is writeable by the current user, Fritzing will be able to
+synchronize this copy with the upstream repository.
